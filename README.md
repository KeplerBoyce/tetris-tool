# Tetris Practice Tool
A tool for practicing Tetris strategies.

### Features
Currently offers finesse practice (including optimal finesse on complex soft drops) and perfect clear setups and solutions for 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th PC.

### Planned features
- More PC setups (DPC, 6th PC, and 7th PC) as well as more advanced lookahead, such as identifying solve chances for various setups.
- Score-aware solver to prioritize PC solutions with quads and extra T-spins.
- Practice tools for other general stacking strategies and T-spin setups.
  - Thinking to create as a little game where some randomly generated board state is given as well as a queue of pieces, and you are tasked with finding a solution to create a particular setup with that queue, such as a simple TSD or a more complex setup like fractal, Kaidan, or C-spin.
- May potentially add an opener practice tool as well.
